      <h1>
  
        <!-- insert the page content here --><p>
      <p>
        This is a very important section in which you will see how we will be able to integrate our html code with our python app and also you will have a very good looking web page by end of this page.
      </p>
      <p>
        
          A web app in Flask, like most frameworks, consists of two kinds of files:
          source code, which is written in Python, and templates, which are written
          in an extended version of HTML. The source code says what the web app
          should do, and the templates say how it should be displayed.
      </p>
      <p>
          Let us create a template first-Click on the mysite in the breadcrumb trail
          :
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              width="595"
              height="114"
              src="style/html.002.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          After you click on the mysite it will take you to the directory of your web
          app from where you accessed your flask_app.py file, we will now create a
          subdirectory call templates where all of your templates will go:
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              width="546"
              height="357"
              src="style/html.004.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          When you open templates a similar-looking page will appear, here we will
          create our first HTML page, type home.html in the files tab, and click on
          the new file. A blank editor will open on your page. It is completely fine
          if you don't have a lot of experience in HTML but you will need to know a
          few things like the basic syntax, but don't worry you can look for HTML
          later we aren't going to code everything in HTML on our own we will either
          be using bootstrap or some other sites for this tutorial I will also
          provide a link if you want to read about HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
          <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp">
              https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp
          </a>
      </p>
      <p>
          you can read about these basics in your free time.
      </p>
      <p>
          Back to our home.html's editor, we will try writing a simple heading using
          the 'h1' tags that we used in flask_app as well.
      </p>
      <p>
          Once you write "h1"; in the editor will on its own create a closing
          tag ;, Write 'home page' in between these tags. Very importantly
          don't forget to save the file.

          After you are done writing the heading in h1 tags, let us go back to the
          flask_app.py and make the following changes:
      </p>
      <p>
          1)Where we have written from flask import Flask we have to add -
      </p>
      <p>
          from flask import Flask, render_template
      </p>
      <p>
          this is a feature of flask that will allow you to call your templates. And
          it should look like :
          <img
              border="0"
              width="357"
              height="31"
              src="style/html.006.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          After you have done this we will make changes to our @app.route and it
          should have
      </p>
      <p>
          return render_template('home. html') and should look like :
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="513"
              height="70"
              src="style/html.008.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          And now when you try to access your website you will see that what you had
          written in between h1 tags will display :
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="462"
              height="283"
              src="style/html.010.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          But this is a very ugly looking website we will now try to make it look a
          bit better so for this we will copy a styling template from the very famous
          bootstrap :
          <img
              border="0"
              width="315"
              height="160"
              src="style/html.012.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          You can use this link to copy the starter template from bootstrap
      </p>
      <p>
          <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/">
              https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/
          </a>
      </p>
      <p>
          After you have copied the code let's go back to our home.html and delete
          whatever code was there and paste this instead of that code. If you save
          this and reload your page you will see a page like this:
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="580"
              height="173"
              src="style/html.014.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          Now this is a very basic website just printing out a statement we want to
          navigate through our website and make it look a bit better by adding a
          navbar and a few aesthetics to the page we will see how , before
          we do that let us change the tab name of our page. The content in between
          h1 tags is our tab name
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="417"
              height="15"
              src="style/html.016.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          If we change this to 'Home Page' and save the file we will see the
          following change on our website :
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="522"
              height="36"
              src="style/html.018.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          You will see that the home page appears on the tab.
      </p>
      <p>
          Now let us go to bootstrap and bring a navbar(I will be attaching the link
          for the same):
      </p>
      <p>
          <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/navbar/">
              https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/navbar/
          </a>
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="469"
              height="290"
              src="style/html.020.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          I like this navbar as it has quite a few options so you can select this one
          or any other of your choice but you will have to figure out how to make the
          changes if you decide to choose another navbar.
      </p>
      <p>
          Now if we copy this code and paste it just below our body tag like :
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="605"
              height="268"
              src="style/html.022.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          Check the indentations once after pasting it on the HTML page, after this
          save and reload your website and you will see a good looking navbar on your
          website like :
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="661"
              height="54"
              src="style/html.024.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          WOW! Looks amazing isn't it, something to flex about! But wait before that
          a lot of work is still pending.
      </p>
      <p>
          I think this navbar will look more classy if it has a dark mode so we will
          change the first line of the navbar code as follows-:
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="630"
              height="26"
              src="style/html.026.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          The line exactly below the body tag has "navbar-light bg-light" we will
          change both the "light" to "dark" as I have done in the snippet above, save
          and reload the site we will get:
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="597"
              height="66"
              src="style/html.028.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p> 
          <img
              width="321"
              height="66"
              src="style/html.030.png"
          />
      </p>
      

      <p>
          Now we will change the names of the options=
      </p>
      <table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" align="left">
          <tbody>
              <tr>
                  <td width="134" height="0">
                  </td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                  <td>
                  </td>
                  <td>
                      <img
                          width="344"
                          height="29"
                          src="style/html.032.jpg"
      
                      />
                  </td>
              </tr>
          </tbody>
      </table>
      <br clear="ALL"/>
      <p>
          The Navbar wrote in bold to some name of website like "Market Zone" looking
          like the one above
      </p>
      <p>
          After this, we will change the nav options of "Features" and "Pricing" to
          "Market" and "Account"
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="591"
              height="79"
              src="style/html.034.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          To
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="499"
              height="145"
              src="style/html.036.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          We will also delete the following highlighted code as we don't need that
          option:
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="582"
              height="230"
              src="style/html.038.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          We will save, reload and go back to our site and see the changes :
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="558"
              height="101"
              src="style/html.040.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          We will see the following options on our navbar and the changes. As you see
          the navbar is in the dark mode we will try converting our site to dark
          mode. And make the following changes in our HTML code just below the
          closing &lt;/body&gt; tag please add the following code:
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="374"
              height="108"
              src="style/html.042.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          Here we create a new tag &lt;style&gt; and in between them we write the
          following code as above, the part where I have written #212121 is a
          hexadecimal color, we can also write a color like white but I prefer this
          as it is a bit different than black and suits good, After doing this save
          and reload the website and see the changes as follows :
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="601"
              height="317"
              src="style/html.044.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          It looks better right? We have now dealt with the basic styling and
          aesthetic of how our website will be. We will just change "Hello ,World" to
          "Home page", I a sure by now you can do it on your own :).
      </p>
      <p>
          Now we look at how we can send data to the templates so for doing this we
          will create a new route and create an items page for the market
          <em>
              (also before doing this it Is advisable to delete your
              @app.route('/about) as it was only made to see how @app.route works)
          </em>
          we add a new @app.route('/market') and define a market_page and we will
          also make a few alterations to the home page by defining a python function
          in there which will make our work of navigating full proof later. And after
          we make the changes in flask_app.py we have to create a new template named
          'market.html' for our new route.
      </p>
      <p>
          This is how our flask_app.py should look now :
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="240"
              height="231"
              src="style/html.046.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          We will also add one @app.route to the same function as when someone calls
          ('/home') there should be a page to go and we add it just below our
          @app.route('/'):
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="325"
              height="161"
              src="style/html.048.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          So whenever someone calls ('home') it will return our default page. (Don't
          forget to save this code.)
      </p>
      <p>
          Now we create a market.html and copy code from home.html and paste it in
          our market.html and then we will make the necessary changes, we have to do
          this because the basic aesthetics of all the pages of your website should
          be the same and not look different.
      </p>
      <p>
          Caution-Your market.html should be in your templates directory only and not
          anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
          This is how your 'market.html' must be looking right now-
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="599"
              height="255"
              src="style/html.050.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          We will carry out the following changes right now to differentiate it from
          home change the heading(h1) content to "This is our market page"
          and title; to "market page":
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="251"
              height="210"
              src="style/html.052.jpg"
      
          />
      </p>
      <p>
          Now let us navigate to
          <a href="http://yourusername.pythonanywhere.com/market">
              http://yourusername.pythonanywhere.com/market
          </a>
      </p>
      <p>
          Please change "yourusername" to what your username is but before that
          don't forget to save and reload the flask_app.py file after the changes we
          have made. Our market page should be like this:
      </p>
      <p>
          <img
              border="0"
              width="462"
              height="247"
              src="style/html.054.jpg"
          />
      </p>
      <summary>In this section, you saw how to use bootstrap, install a. You also have a very good looking presentable website </summary>
      <p>
          Now we will see how to send data from route to HTML
      </p>
    <div id="menubar">
        <ul id="menu">
          <li><a href="contact.html">Sending Data to templates</a></li>
        </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
</html>
