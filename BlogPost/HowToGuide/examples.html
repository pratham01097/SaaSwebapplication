                In this section we will create an account with pyhtonanywhere that is a python ide and a cloud hosting service that allows you to host websites for free, we will also see the features of pythonanywhere 
            </p>
        </p>
        <p>
            We will be working with pyhtonanywhere which is an online IDE
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a few different subscription plans at pythonanywhere but for our
            project, the free one would do. We will first start by creating our
            Pythonanywhere account or login if you already have one, We can go to
            Pythonanywhere either by searching on google or I am also attaching a link
            below:
        </p>
                <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/login/?next=/">
            https://www.pythonanywhere.com/login/?next=/
        </a>
        <p>
            <img
                width="789"
                height="209"
                src="style/clip_image002.jpg"
                align="right"
                hspace="12"
            />
        <br clear="ALL"/>

        <p>
            If you are new to pythonanywhere click on signup and you will be redirected
            to a page looking like this
        </p>
        <p>
            <img
                border="0"
                width="601"
                height="274"
                src="style/clip_image004.jpg"
            />
        </p>
  
        <p>
            As I already mentioned that a beginner account would do for our project so
            we click on create a free beginner account and a screen like this will
            appear
        </p>
        <p>
            <img
                src="style/clip_image006.jpg"
                width="601"
                height="268"
                border="0"
            />
        </p>
        <p>
            After you have created the account you will get steps of pythonanywhere and
            basic guidelines of the UI of pythonanywhere read through the steps once, I
            will also explain the fields again
        </p>
        <p>
            Console-In this part you can see the active consoles of python bash or SQL
        </p>
        <p>
            Files-This place you will see the running files of your project, with the
            free version you can only work with one project at a time
        </p>
        <p>
            Notebooks- you cant access this with a free account
        </p>
        <p>
            Web apps- in this place you can see the running web apps
        </p>
        <p>
            Now we will create our first web app, click on the pythonanywhere logo and
            go to the home page and from that click on the WEB tab on the top right
            <img
                border="0"
                width="594"
                height="52"
                src="style/clip_image009.jpg"
            />
        </p>
        <p>
            When you click on the web tab you will be redirected to this site-
        </p>
        <p>

            <img
                border="0"
                width="603"
                height="285"
                src="style/clip_image014.jpg"
            />
        </p>

            <br clear="ALL"/>
            Click on next and there will be list of microweb frameworks, select flask
            and after that, there will be a list of different python versions and
            select python 3.9 or whichever is the latest version. After you select the
            version of python,this page will appear:
            <p>
            <img
                width="225"
                height="169"
                src="style/clip_image017.jpg"
            />
        </p>
        <p>
            This page is asking you where you want to put your code. Code on
        PythonAnywhere is stored in your home directory, <code>/home/</code>    <em>yourusername</em>, and in its subdirectories. Now, Flask is a
            particularly lightweight framework, and you can write a simple Flask app in
            a single file. PythonAnywhere is asking you where it should create a
            directory and put a single file with a really simple website. The default
        should be fine; it will create a subdirectory of your home directory called<code>my site</code> and thewill put the Flask code into a file called    <code>flask_app.py</code> inside that directory.
        </p>
        <p>

            After this configuration page for this site will appear :
        </p>
        <p>
            <img
                border="0"
                width="562"
                height="266"
                src="style/clip_image020.jpg"
            />
        </p>
        <p>
            On the top left section of the page Is the hostname for this website and
            add a web app (only for paid accounts) as we are using the free version we
            have to log in once in three months and click on Run until 3 months and the
            website is good to run.
        </p>
        <p>
            So now python anywhere has created a default website for us we can see that
            by right-clicking on our hostname and opening it in a new tab and a
            similar-looking website will appear on your screen :
        </p>
        <p>
            <img
                border="0"
                width="402"
                height="138"
                src="style/clip_image022.jpg"
            />
        </p>
        <p>

            Ok so now let's go back to our configuration page so that we can have a
            look at this simple code.

            Once you are back on the configuration page, scroll down and go to the
            section where CODE is the subheading and you will see options like Source
            code, a working directory like this:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img
                border="0"
                width="586"
                height="109"
                src="style/clip_image026.jpg"
            />
        </p>
        <p>
            You have to click on go to directory of the 'source code'

            A page with contents of your subdirectory will appear like this:
        </p>
        <p>
            <img
                width="523"
                height="165"
                src="style/clip_image029.jpg"
            />
            <br clear="ALL"/>
        </p>
        <p>
            Click on the flask_app.py file you see under the files ,there will be a
            very simple code of our website In that file looking similar to :
        </p>
        <p>
            <img
                border="0"

                height="195"
                src="style/clip_image031.jpg"
            />
        </p>
        <p>
            We will look through this code line by line
        </p>
        <p>
            <img
                border="0"
                width="162"
                height="24"
                src="style/clip_image032.jpg"
            />
        </p>
        <p>
            This just means that you are importing the framework
        </p>
        <p>
            2)
 

            <img

                height="27"
                src="style/clip_image033.jpg"
            />
        </p>
        <p>
            This creates a Flask application to run your code.
        </p>
        <p>

            <img

            This decorator specifies that the following function defines what happens
        when someone goes to the location "/" on your site - eg. if they go to    <code>http://</code><em>yourusername</em><code>.pythonanywhere.com/</code>.
        If you wanted to define what happens when they go to <code>http://</code><em>yourusername</em><code>.pythonanywhere.com/xyz </code>then you'd use    <code>@app.route('/xyz')</code> instead.
        </p>

            />
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a function defined in python which returns a string that we see on
            our web page.

            You can try changing this to "your name" and save the file and reload by
            clicking on
            <img
                border="0"
                width="21"
                height="19"
                src="style/clip_image038.jpg"
            />
            this button after saving and then go back to your side in the next tab and
            reload it, you will see that
        </p>
        <p>
            'your name' appears instead of 'Hello from flask!'.
