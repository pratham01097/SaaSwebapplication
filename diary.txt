when I first read the mail about selecting modules and saw the description of 1028 I was very excited to take up this module and challenge myself with something tricky and useful
I had made a few basic projects using python and learned about the language. When I got a mail that I was selected for 1028 it made me very happy and then I started with selecting my projects first and i got the allotment of my project. I was a bit scared after seeing the description of the project as it had a few things like git hub flask and python anywhere to which i was completely new to.
I started off my journey by seeing a complete tutorial of git hub and learning how to use GitHub at the very first and was my first step towards the learning process. Initially, I had a few problems with GitHub like using it with vs code I faced a few errors which took time to overcome and start using GitHub fully
after git hub I took a basic tutorial on flask on how to create a basic flask website after that it caught my interest and I started building a web app using flask which had basic services like login and navigating through the navbar
during this, I faced several issues that I couldn't debug like linking the SQLAlchemy to the vs code and creating a .db file 
I also learned how to make python packages and along with that I added templates of HTML to the website and took a basic idea of using jinja syntax
WEDNESDAY 19th January 
We had our first meeting for which I was very nervous and scared as I had not understood my project very clearly and did not even have experience in flaks before the meeting 
I was also not very sure about the diary so I had written it down instead of writing it digitally so I was not able to present it.
The first meeting was very helpful for me as i got a good idea about the project I am working on and I knew where I could start from 
now I have a very good idea about how my initial pages of login and forms should be like starting with creating a basic website where I can navigate through the web app
I also got to know about a subscription app called notion from which I take influence 

THURSDAY 20th January 
I started working with forms in Flask and explored various new terms like wtforms and importing diffrent feilds using wtforms like SubmitField and others which are very convinient i also started looking at the jinja syntax and its uses which will help in using flask and implement logic code. Today i also tried to create a form for sign in and password 

Friday 21th January 
I now started working with templates directory where i created a basic html which will have common asthetics for all the navigated tabs and using jinja syntax i used to create various more templates rather than writing the html code again and again now i have created 4 diffrent templates using one base template and jinja syntax where you can easily navigate through the routes using the navbar and used a function called {{ url_for('home_page')}} using jinja syntax .

Monday 24th January 
I now wanted to add the submitted details of the form to a databse but i wasnt able to do so , i Have been working on finding a debug solution for the same i also reffered many diffrent solutions and tutorials but not able to do so, alternately i tried to store the informatio in  a python list which could work well for less number of data but ddefinetly if i could work with a databse will be better. I also tried to learn how to send mails using the STMP service which might be helpful for us in the future.

I will be traveling back to Belfast on 25th and will reach Belfast on 26th January so i have asked John to host my meeting on a later date and our weekly meeting is now scheduled  on 27th Thursday 1pm

27th January-Thursday
I had a very productive meeting with John,now quite a few things were more clear in my mind and i knew what are my immidieate short term goals and also got a few links from john which will clear my database doubts and along with that i also guided to the correct direction of How-to-guide. 
In this particular meeting with John he asked me to focus on Jinja Syntax and the database connection, he also sent me a link of blog that can be refrenced from.
So I have added a tab for Databases and Jinja with each and every step and how to use them to my how to guide.

28th January-Friday 
John had asked me to follow a blog and use that to get myself clear with pythonanywhere and i started working with that blog, the blog was about creating a simple website and using git in pythonanywehre 
https://blog.pythonanywhere.com/121/
I created a basic flask application using this blog,this blog was a very excellent place to solve all my problems and i finally was able to work with databse and was sucessful entering the database and access it using pythonanywhere's SQL console 
along with cracking through my database issue i also had a very good hands on experience with pythonamywhere and i finally can deploy my code from vs to here.

29th January
I had to move my code from VS CODE to pythonanywhere and i started exploring pythonanywhere, i started with shifting my routes then my basic template and checking if it would work and after a few changes#
my code started working in pythonanywhere and i was able to get the similiar base 1 pmsite working.after the base i imported my market zone and then the fo rms, i had made a very silly mistake while importing tIe form which took immediatey time
for debbuging and i finally found out that i had used the app.config['SECRET KEY '] which is essentiaI for forms to get working.
31st January 
After i was able to use my code on pythonanywhere, i was going to put details of forms into a database and i was going to connect
the datbase but when i tried to do so i got a very silly error and i was not able to get it working then n finally messaged John and seeked his help again 
and aparently i was doing a very silly mistake and had not selected the correct path while using ipython. I was so irritated with databases but now finally it is working 
After that i finally strated with my how to guide and started making a mindmap of how i will go about the guide and making the html.
1st February 
I finally started working on the How-to-guide and I was planning to make a web page with each and every step from knowing and understanding what a flask framework is, so I decided to start writing about the flask framework and its definition, this guide is targeting various types of people and new beginners can be one of them too so it was a good idea to start talking about flask.
After Flask, The most important thing is pyhtonanywhere, the IDE which we will be using so I decided to explain pythonanywhere and all the steps to create an account first then the usage and functions of the IDE. This guide could be useful for someone who is used to python but new to pythonanywhere and also the beginners and also for someone who is trying to learn new IDEs and use their existing projects on them. So I started with the steps to create a pythonanywhere account and followed by explaining the features and how pythonanywhere had already created a default app for everyone’s convenience and I also explained the lines of the code for beginners and people new to the flask.
After this I added a page about @app.routes as no one wants their website to be only a page long and also this was mainly for the beginners with flask to understand how different routes are created on pythonanywhere.
Then I added a tab about HTML templates which provide the beautification of our website so I added a few code snippets and screenshots of bootstrap,HTML and explained how we can create a good look basic aesthetic for our app, In this, I have pasted code and attached all the links everywhere so that newcomers who don’t have much experience with python also can do this with a lot of ease and convenience I have also pasted the links for all bootstrap pages where I have copied the code from and I have also explained each and every line where I have updated/changed the code according to my site,
2nd February 
Now I decided to start with a very interesting feature of flask and jinja wherein they can send data to the HTML using a python code this was a very important thing to do as beginners won’t find this very amusing, the people who are new to flask will realize how powerful the jinja and flask is as it saves a lot of their time and reduces the scope of error.
Then I created a page about jinja where I first made a few templates by copy-pasting and finding and making changes and then I asked them to delete all their code and use jinja syntax so that even they should realize that so much of their effort could’ve been done so easily and obviously the people who have used other languages for development would’ve been surprised by how you can create 1000s of pages by just one line of jinja syntax and would be impressed with the power of jinja and flask.
3rd February 
After yesterdays long slides I decided to get back on a small topic that I had forgot to look into and that was, the navbar was not functional, I had added a bootstrap navbar but I didn’t link pages to it because there was a better way again using jinja syntax that was better and error-proof as even if you change your route it will still take you to that page as it takes you to the defined function and is called as {{url_for}} this was a very important thing to learn for beginners as well as experienced programmers 
After that I wrote about the wtforms which is also a function of flask and told them how to create a page for login, now a days all the webpages have login details so it was a key thing for the beginners to learn and others to learn about the wtforms by flask 
Finally, I added the database tab where I clearly explained each and every step with screenshots code snippets and as well as database screenshots where it was key to understand that using databases with python anywhere is so much more convenient to use compared to other IDEs and you can also access the database console
4th February -:
I was now checking my HTML file and the content and also worked on the final touchup of all the tabs once and after I was done with the howto guide I started working on the diary and wrote all the details and was ready to submit and very nervous hope everything goes well.
