when i first read the mail about selecting modules and saw the descripation of 1028 i was very excited to take up this module and challenge myself with something tricky and useful
i had made a few basic projects using python and learned about the language. When i got a mail that i was selected for 1028 it made me very happy and then i started off with selecting my projects first and i got the allotment of my project. I was a bit scared after seeing the description of the project as it had a few things like git hub flask and python anywhere to which i was completly new to.
I started off my journey by seeing a complete tutorial of git hub and learning how to use github at the very first and was my first step towards the learning process. Initially i had a few problems with github like using it with vs code i faced a few errors which took time to over come and start using github fully
after git hub i took a basic tutorial on flask on how to create a basic flask website after that it caught my intrest and i strated builind a web app using flask which had basic services like login and navigating through navbar
during this i faced a number of issues which i couldn't debug like linking the SQLAlchemy to the vs code and creating a .db file 
i also lerant how to make python pacakages and along with that i added templates of html to the website and took a basic idea of using jinja syntax
WEDNESDAY 19th January 
We had our first meeting for which i was very nervous and scared as i had not understood my project very clearly and did not even have experience in flaks before the meeting 
i was also not very sure about the diary so i had written it down instead of writting it digitally so i was not able to present it.
The first meeting was very helpful for me as i got a good idea about the project i am working on and i knew where i could start from 
now i have a very good idea about how my initial pages of login and forms should like starting with creating a basic website where i can navigate through the web app
i also got to know about a subscription app called notion from which i take influence 

THURSDAY 20th January 
I started working with forms in Flaskk and explored various new terms like wtforms and importing diffrent feilds using wtforms like SubmitField and others which are very convinient i also started looking at the jinja syntax and its uses which will help in using flask and implement logic code. Today i also tried to create a form for sign in and password 

Friday 21th January 
I now started working with templates directory where i created a basic html which will have common asthetics for all the navigated tabs and using jinja syntax i used to create various more templates rather than writing the html code again and again now i have created 4 diffrent templates using one base template and jinja syntax where you can easily navigate through the routes using the navbar and used a function called {{ url_for('home_page')}} using jinja syntax .

Monday 24th January 
I now wanted to add the submitted details of the form to a databse but i wasnt able to do so , i Have been working on finding a debug solution for the same i also reffered many diffrent solutions and tutorials but not able to do so, alternately i tried to store the informatio in  a python list which could work well for less number of data but ddefinetly if i could work with a databse will be better. I also tried to learn how to send mails using STMP service which might be Helpful for us in the future.

I will be travelling back to belfast on 25th and will reach belfast on 26th january so i have asked Jhon to host my meeting on a later date and our weekly meeting is now scheduled  on 27th Thursday 1pm

27th January-Thursday
I had a very productive meeting with John,now quite a few things were more clear in my mind and i knew what are my immidieate short term goals and also got a few links from john which will clear my database doubts and along with that i also guided to the correct direction of How-to-guide. 

28th January-Friday 
John had asked me to follow a blog and use that to get myself clear with pythonanywhere and i started working with that blog, the blog was about creating a simple website and using git in pythonanywhre 
https://blog.pythonanywhere.com/121/
I created a basic flask application using this blog,this blog was a very excellent place to solve all my problems and i finally was able to work with databse and was sucessful entering the database and access it using pythonanywhere's SQL console 
along with cracking through my database issue i also had a very good hands on experience with pythonamywhere and i finally can deploy my code from vs to here.

29th January
I had to move my code from VS CODE to pythonanywhere and i started exploring pythonanywhere, i started with shifting my routes then my basic template and checking if it would work and after a few changes#
my code started working in pythonanywhere and i was able to get the similiar base website working.after the base i imported my market zone and then the forms, i had made a very silly mistake while importing the form which took quite of my time
for debbuging and i finally found out that i had used the app.config['SECRET KEY '] which is essential for forms to get working.
31st January 
After i was able to use my code on pythonanywhere, i was going to put details of forms into a database and i was going to connect
the datbase but when i tried to do so i got a very silly error and i was not able to get it working then n finally messaged John and seeked his help again 
and aparently i was doing a very silly mistake and had not selected the correct path while using ipython. I was so irritated with databases but now finally it is working 
After that i finally strated with my how to guide and started making a mindmap of how i will go about the guide and making the html.
1st February 
I started reading howto make how to guide uploaded by john and followed the steps and selected my template for how to guide, now i have started
writing the details in word document and im going to use the converter and then put it into the html code.
